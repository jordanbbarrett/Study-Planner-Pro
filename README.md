# Study-Planner-Pro

Students often struggle to manage their time effectively, especially when balancing multiple classes, deadlines, and personal commitments. This lack of organization can lead to missed deadlines, poor exam preparation, and added stress. While tools like calendar apps and to-do lists exist, theyâ€™re not tailored to the unique needs of students and often lack features like prioritizing study sessions based on deadlines or tracking progress on specific topics. A simple, student-focused study planner could help address this issue by providing an easy way to schedule, prioritize, and track study sessions, making it easier to stay on top of coursework and reduce stress.
